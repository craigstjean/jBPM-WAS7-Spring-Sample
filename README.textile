h1. Introduction

This is a sample jBPM 5.4 project that leverages the following technologies:

* jBPM 5.4
* WebSphere Application Server 7.0
* JPA 1
* Oracle
* Spring MVC

The goal of the project is a very basic customer / clerk interaction at a hotel with the following steps:

# Customer Requests Room
# Clerk Looks for Rooms
# A service returns a room number, or a default for no rooms
# If no rooms, Clerk Tells Customer No Rooms
# If there was a room, Clerk Gives Room Number
# End

h2. Project Preparation

# Load WorkflowTestWeb/doc/jbpmschemaexport.sql into Oracle
# Load WorkflowTestWeb/doc/htschemaexport.sql into Oracle
# Create jdbc/jBPM_TestDS Data Source in WebSphere pointing to Oracle (then restart WebSphere)
# Deploy EAR project to WebSphere

h1. Questionable Items

* Is JbpmService used in this way thread safe?
* Is JbpmService used in this way causing overhead?
* Is the way roomResolver is passed into the flow correct?  Better way?

h1. Current Issues

* Completing the first task (should be Customer Requests Room) does not move the task to the next step
